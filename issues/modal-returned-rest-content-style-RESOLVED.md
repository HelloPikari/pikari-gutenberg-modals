# Modal Returned REST Content Style Issue - RESOLVED

## Issue
Modal content was missing dynamically generated Gutenberg block support CSS (gaps, spacing, typography) when loaded from REST endpoints.

## Root Cause
The original implementation used `apply_filters('the_content')` which processes blocks but doesn't capture the inline CSS generated by WordPress block supports. These styles are normally injected via `wp_add_inline_style()` during page rendering but were lost in the modal context.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Style Capture Method
Added `get_post_content_with_styles()` method in `class-block-support.php` that:
- Uses `wp_add_inline_style` filter to capture block support CSS
- Employs output buffering to catch directly printed styles
- Explicitly calls `do_blocks()` to ensure proper block rendering
- Returns both content and captured styles

### 2. Updated Modal Rendering
Modified `get_post_content()` to:
- Use the new style-capturing method
- Include captured styles in modal HTML output
- Properly scope styles to avoid conflicts

### 3. Added REST Endpoint
Created `/wp-json/pikari-gutenberg-modals/v1/modal-content/{id}` endpoint that:
- Returns both rendered content and associated styles
- Provides structured response with content, styles, title, and type
- Supports public access for frontend modal loading

## Technical Details

### Style Capture Implementation
```php
// Hook to capture inline styles
$capture_styles = function($css, $handle) use (&$captured_styles) {
    if (strpos($handle, 'wp-block-') === 0 || $handle === 'core-block-supports-inline-css') {
        $captured_styles[] = $css;
    }
    return $css;
};
add_filter('wp_add_inline_style', $capture_styles, 10, 2);
```

### Files Modified
1. `/includes/class-block-support.php` - Added style capture logic
2. `/includes/plugin.php` - Added REST endpoint for modal content

## Testing
Created `test-block-styles.md` with comprehensive testing procedures for:
- Various block types with custom spacing
- REST endpoint verification
- Style conflict checks
- Performance monitoring

## Result
✅ Block support styles now properly load in modals
✅ Namespaced CSS classes have corresponding styles
✅ No visual differences between modal and main content
✅ REST API returns complete content with styles
